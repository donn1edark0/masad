== Architecture Constraints

Budget:: 

Limited initial funding requiring cost-effective solutions.

Technology Stack:: 

Utilize open-source technologies to minimize costs.

Regulatory Compliance:: 

Must comply with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).

Integration:: 

Need for seamless integration with GPS and notification services.

=== Cloud Native

Cloud-Native Solution:: 

Microservices Architecture: Utilize microservices to ensure the solution is modular, scalable, and easy to manage.

Containerization:: 

Use Docker to containerize the microservices.

Orchestration with Kubernetes:: 

Kubernetes will manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of the containerized applications.


=== Must be Hosted in a Cloud

Cloud Providers:: 

AWS

Managed Services:: 

EC2, Document DB, S3

=== Cloud-Exit Strategy:

Portability::

Designed the system to be portable across different cloud providers. Using cloud-agnostic technologies, such as Kubernetes for orchestration, PostgreSQL and MongoDB for databases, and Docker for containerization.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)::

Using Terraform to manage the cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the infrastructure setup can be replicated easily on another cloud provider if needed.

Data Backup and Migration::

Implement regular data backup strategies

Abstracted Services::

Use abstraction layers for cloud services to minimize dependency on any specific cloud provider's. For instance, will use cloud-agnostic logging and monitoring tools like Grafana.

=== Cost-Effective Solution:

Serverless Computing::

Where appropriate, use serverless computing services like AWS Lambda

Auto-Scaling:: 

Implement auto-scaling policies 

Monitoring and Alerts:: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerts to detect and address any unexpected cost spikes
