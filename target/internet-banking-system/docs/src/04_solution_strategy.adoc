== Solution Strategy

The solution strategy for "Where's Fluffy?" involves adopting a cloud-native architecture with microservices and containerization,
leveraging managed cloud services for scalability and reliability, ensuring portability and flexibility through IaC and a cloud-exit strategy,
focusing on cost-effectiveness through serverless computing and auto-scaling, delivering a high-quality user experience,
and following agile development practices with CI/CD for efficient and effective development and deployment.
