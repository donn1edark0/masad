**Description**

The "Where's Fluffy?" system is deployed across multiple environments to ensure efficient development, testing, and production operations. It includes the following key infrastructure elements:

1. Development Environment: Used by developers to write and test code. Contains local instances of the web server, user management module, pet management module, and MongoDB database.
2. Testing Environment: Used for integration and user acceptance testing. Mirrors the production environment to catch any potential issues before deployment.
3. Production Environment: The live environment where the actual system runs, accessible to end users. It includes a load balancer, web server instances, application servers for user and pet management modules, and a MongoDB cluster for high availability and performance.

Motivation::

The deployment structure ensures

- Separation of Concerns: Development, testing, and production environments are isolated to prevent interference and ensure stability.
- Scalability: The production environment is designed to handle increasing loads with multiple web servers and a clustered MongoDB database.
- Reliability: High availability is achieved through clustering and load balancing in the production environment.
- Security: Sensitive data is protected through secure communication channels and isolated environments.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

- High Availability: MongoDB cluster and load balancers ensure the system remains available even if some components fail.
- Performance: Distributed architecture allows horizontal scaling of web and application servers.
- Security: Environments are isolated, and secure communication channels are used to protect data in transit.
